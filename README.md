# Emergency Planner Overview

The Emergency Planner is a comprehensive web application designed to help users create personalized emergency preparation plans. This application assists users in developing three critical aspects of emergency preparedness:

1. Emergency Bagpack Planning
2. Emergency Storage Management
3. Emergency Fund Planning

As a software engineer, I developed this application to address the growing need for systematic emergency preparation in our increasingly unpredictable world. The application uses modern web technologies and an intuitive user interface to make emergency planning accessible to everyone.
